### 🔧 What I'm usually hacking on

- Character-level bigram & trigram chains  
- Bag-of-characters histograms + cosine-based word projection  
- Greedy generation with simple cycle detection  
- Forcing generated gibberish to match a real vocabulary  
- Clean, readable C++ code (because complexity should be earned)

### 🛠️ Flagship toy project

**[Vectmo](https://github.com/NeuraLumina/Vectmo)**  
A minimalist C++ character-level language model that:
- learns bigram statistics from raw text  
- generates continuations with basic repetition avoidance  
- projects every wild token onto your actual word list using cosine similarity on character histograms  

→ Produces surprisingly coherent mimicry with almost no trainable parameters
